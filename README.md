# gaming-ecommerce-website
Overview
Our project aims to develop a robust gaming e-commerce website that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase various gaming products, including video games, consoles, accessories, and merchandise. The website will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, while PHP will serve as the backend technology. We will use MySQL as the database management system to store product information, user data, and transaction records. Our development team consists of four talented members: Ezaz, Tasin, Marium, and Sarah.
